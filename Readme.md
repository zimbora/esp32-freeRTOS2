## SYSFILE

  On startup 3 directories are created:
  - /etc/settings
  - /home/app/settings
  - /home/app/records

#### /etc/settings

  Stores system configuration

#### /app/settings

  Can be used by user to store app configurations\
  Use sysfile.write_file() method to store data\
  and sysfile.read_file() to read data

#### /app/records

  Use this directory to store data that should be sent to mqtt broker\
  An autonomous service will be checking for new files and always that is possible it will send to mqtt broker

## Commands

  Commands are passed through MQTT with topic prefix/fw/#\
  The following commands are available

  On receive (topic:payload):
  - :prefix/status (update clock)
  - :prefix/fw/reboot/set : 1 (reboots system)
  - :prefix/fw/reset/set : 1 (reset memory)
  - :prefix/fw/clean/records/set : 1 (clean records in memory)
  - :prefix/fw/fota/update/set : {"url":""} (updates fw)

## Configurations

  Configurations are done through MQTT with topic :prefix/fw/#\
  The following commands are available

  On receive
  - :prefix/fw/settings/modem/set : {"apn":"","pwd":"","user":"","band":(uint8_t),"cops":(uint16_t)} (updates modem settings)
  - :prefix/fw/settings/wifi/set : {"ssid":"","pwd":""} (updates wifi settings)
  - :prefix/fw/settings/mqtt/set : {"host":"","user":"","pass":"","active":(bool)} (configure 2nd mqtt) connection)
  - :prefix/fw/settings/keepalive/set : {"active":(bool),"period":(seconds)}
  - :prefix/fw/settings/log/set : {"active":(bool),"level":(0-disabled;1-verbose;2-debug;3-info;4-warn;5-error)}
  - :prefix/fw/ar/set : {}
  - :prefix/fw/alarm/set : {}
  - :prefix/fw/js/code/set : (file)

## MQTT

  Device can have one or two connections\
  The first connection will be always enabled\
  A second one can be activated and in that case all publish messages in app directory will\
  be redirected for this second connection

### Prefix

  Prefix identifies device in MQTT broker and it is composed by project + uid\
  prefix = MQTT_PROJECT+"/"+uid

  MQTT_PROJECT is defined in credentials file\

  uid = MQTT_UID_PREFIX+macAddress
  MQTT_UID_PREFIX is also defined in credentials file\


### Subscriptions

  Device subscribes the following topics:
   - prefix/status
   - prefix/fw/#
   - prefix/app/#

  #/fw/# topic is reserved for device configurations

### On Connection

sends the following topics:
  - /status - online
  - /model - FW_MODEL
  - /version - FW_VERSION
  - /uptime
  - /reboot_cause_cpu0
  - /reboot_cause_cpu1

### Running

sends the following topics with keepalive period:
  - /uptime
  - /rssi
  - /tech

### Clocksync
  Clock is synched when a ':prefix/status' msg is received

### Available Topics

- [/fw/get] (#fw_)
- [/fw/reboot/set] (#fw_reboot_)
- [/fw/reset/set] (#fw_reset_)
- [/fw/info/get] (#fw_info_)
- [/fw/clean/records/set] (#fw_info_)

- [/fw/alarm/set] (#fw_alarm_)
- [/fw/serial/read/get] (#fw_serial_read_)
- [/fw/serial/write/get] (#fw_serial_write_)

## Autorequests
  Use mqtt topic "#/fw/ar/set" to configure autorequests

  The available sensors depends on your hardware and can be:
  - rs485
  - ...


  The following format is available for rs485:

  ```
  {
    "autorequests":
    {
      "rs485": [
        {
          "ref": "Itemp",
          "modbus": [1,3,834,2],
          "type": "UINT32BE",
          "period":60
        },
        {
          "ref": "Ipress",
          "modbus": [1,3,836,2],
          "type": "UINT16BE",
          "period":60
        },
        {
          "ref": "Ivb",
          "modbus": [1,3,806,4],
          "type": "INT16BE",
          "period":60
        },
        {
          "ref": "Ivc",
          "modbus": [1,3,810,4],
          "type": "FLOATBE",
          "period":60
        }]
    }
  }
  ```

  All autorequests with `app` key will be managed by app module. So, when a sensor with ref `asd` is configured, the program will call app.getValue method to request the value of `asd` sensor.
  It's up to you provide code to return `asd` value

  ```
  {
    "autorequests": {
      "app": [
        {
          "ref": "asd",
          "type": "FLOATBE",
          "period": 60
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

## Alarms
  Use mqtt topic "#/fw/alarm/set" to configure alarms\
  Alarms will use ref field to get configured sensor from autorequests.\
  The following format is available:

  ```
  {
    "alarms": [
      {
        "ref": "Itemp",
        "min_value":15,
        "max_value":30,
        "period":15
      },
      {
        "ref": "Ipress",
        "min_value":1.1,
        "period":15
      },
      {
        "ref": "Ivb",
        "diff":1,
        "max_value":10,
        "period":15
      },
      {
        "ref": "Ivc",
        "period":15
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  Such as autorequests, alarms with `app` key will also be managed by app module. So, when a sensor with ref `asd` is configured, the program will call app.getValue method to request the value of `asd` sensor.\
  It's up to you provide code to return `asd` value

  ```
  {
    "alarms": [
      {
        "ref": "asd",
        "period": 15,
        "max_value": 150,
        "min_value": 130
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
